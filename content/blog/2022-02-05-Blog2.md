A general summary of project progress as of February 5th, 2022.

## Mechanical
Built and assembled a completely 3D printed version of the bracket and hot
end gears to see if the geometry was feasible. Followed this up by using
learnings from that prototype to build a version using aluminum shafts for
better movement and stiffness. Learned several things as a result of these
prototypes:
- Geometric tolerances for 3D printing fits
- Shaft sizing
- Bending radius for the bowden tube


## Electrical
Proceeding as planned (see the [last post][last-post]).

## Software
### Firmware
Sticking to plan (see the [last post][last-post]). Some more investigation of the
appropriate place to modify Marlin is continuing.

### Slicers
Sticking to plan (see the [last post][last-post]).
