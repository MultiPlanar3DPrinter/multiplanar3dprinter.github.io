A general summary of project progress as of January 28th, 2022.

__Mechanical__
The current status of the mechanical design is to begin prototyping key elements of the gear train system. The progress is to do a CAD design revision to prepare it for manufacturing and allow for further testing.

__Electrical__

Following the high level block diagram shown below, each of the required peripheral circuit connections to the MCU are to be fleshed out in detail. Additionally, the microcontroller used will be an STM32 Cortex-M4 chip. Further detail will be provided on the circuitry and parts used once the schematic is completed and the BOM is confirmed.

The goal is to complete the schematic, PCB layout and ordering process in time to start testing the board by Reading Week.

Confirmed that all system electrical components and peripherals should be CSA approved for the symposium.

__Software__
Basic investigation into Marlin is ongoing. It looks promising. Marlin would provide existing facilities
for controlling the 2 additional stepper motors. It would need extra logic added to identify the G code
that specifies the extruder direction, but once this is found it should be straight-forward (unless I just
jinxed myself).

Investigation into slicers is also ongoing. Various existing slicers have been found that are designed: to be
extensible (with 5-axis control or different slicing algorithms in mind); which already have 4-axis control or
printing plane control (so it might be easier to add a fifth-axis); or which have some rudimentary 5-axis
control (but which aren't designed with our architecture in mind).
