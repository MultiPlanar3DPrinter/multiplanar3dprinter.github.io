Following the high level block diagram shown below, each of the required peripheral circuit connections to the MCU are to be fleshed out in detail. Additionally, the microcontroller used will be an STM32 Cortex-M4 chip. Further detail will be provided on the circuitry and parts used once the schematic is completed and the BOM is confirmed.

The goal is to complete the schematic, PCB layout and ordering process in time to start testing the board by Reading Week.
