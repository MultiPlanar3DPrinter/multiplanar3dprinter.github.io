## Electrical

The PCB layout for the custom controller board has been completed.

The board is a 2 layer board to save on production time as additional time will
be needed for the manufacturer to assemble the boards. In general, the layout of
the components is reminiscent of the stock Ender 3 controller board, with the
mounting holes and USB placement matching the Ender 3 board exactly so that it
can be secured in the same enclosure. For the ICs, the layout requirements were
followed in the data sheets and the power lines were kept as thick as possible
to ensure that they wouldnâ€™t burn up with high current. Some vias were also
added for heat dissipation near the MOSFETs, power area and the motor
controllers, wherever is most prone to heating up. Lastly, test points were
added for connections that are not easily accessible for testing and debugging,
which should hopefully make the process easier.
