## Electrical
Completed a detailed high level block diagram of all required peripherals with
all the signals that the microcontroller needs to drive. The total number of
pins required to drive all the peripherals is 40, with 3 pins per motor
controller for EN, STEP, DIR, 8 pins for the LCD, 2 pins for USB and one pin
each for the thermistors, limit switches, fans and heaters.

From the pin requirements, Marlin firmware recommendations and part
availability, the STM32F401RC microcontroller was chosen for this board.

The stepper motor drivers were chosen as A4988s because TMC stepper drivers were
largely out of stock, and since A4988s are basic parts, they are more readily
available. Additionally, the stock Ender 3 uses A4988 stepper motor drivers so
they should work well with the stepper motors already.

## Software
Marlin has had previous attempts to add [5 axis
capabilities][Marlin-16549].
