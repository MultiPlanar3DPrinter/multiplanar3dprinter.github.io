A general summary of project progress as of March 19th, 2022.
This week was symposium!

## Software
### Slicer/Firmware Integration
We also attempted to print a shape that would require multiple movements during
the print, however the end result was never perfect. This involved needing to
manually figure out the movements required for each new positioning before
resetting the coordinates with where the printer expects the nozzle to be at.
This worked for alignment, but when the printer started printing, the part would
not be perfectly aligned.

The following gif shows the print that resulted from manual alignment.

And this one shows the alignment of the first transition in the print.

Then, the second transition in the print.

And here you can see the clear misalignment once it starts printing.

## Electrical
STM32CubeIDE was used to configure the pins and run preliminary tests for the
functionality of all the peripherals. A blinking Test LED was used to indicate
when the program was running. The motor controllers and PWM control of the fans
were the primary options tested and were able to effectively drive and control
the speed of each of those respectively. Other peripherals were GPIOs that were
confirmed to connect to their respective pins properly, but more detailed
testing was planned when the proper functionality was added through the
firmware.

However, a problem that we ran into when trying to run the Klipper firmware was
that the USB is functional when set up and programmed from the STM32CubeIDE, but
does not work when the Klipper firmware is loaded. We did not have the time to
properly debug the reasons why, especially with the volume of code that makes up
Klipper, so instead we resorted to running Klipper on a Raspberry Pi which would
drive two separate Ender 3 motor controllers in order to add the additional
stepper motor and limit switch functionality we needed.

## Symposium
Setup went relatively smoothly, though the staircase print was still misaligned
more often than not. Thus, we decided to simply print the MTE block over the
course of the symposium instead. This was also great because the shape was
pretty exciting to look at and all the people seemed pretty impressed by it.
