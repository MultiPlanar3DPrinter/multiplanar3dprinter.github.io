## About Us

We are Mechatronics Engineering students at the University of Waterloo and this is our Final Year Capstone Design Project.

## About the Project

The Multi-Planar 3D Printer is a revolutionary 3D printhead design for the Ender 3 that reduces sacrificial support material and post-processing times for 3D prints without compromising on part complexity. It accomplishes this by introducing additional axes of rotation to allow for printing along angled planes that are not parallel to the base layer. By doing this in a low-cost design, we allow freedom from traditional 3D printing constraints and open unforeseen design possibilities.
